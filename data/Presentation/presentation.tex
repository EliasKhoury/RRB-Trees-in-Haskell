\frametitle{Background}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Invented by researchers at EPFL in Lausanne
	\item RRB-Trees are part of the ongoing development of the Scala Programming Language
	\item The goal is to present a datastructure which can be concatenated in O(log n) time at no cost to other operations

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
 
\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Application}

\begin{itemize}

	\item RRB-Trees can be used to implement an efficient vector datastructure
	\item Not only is the concatenation fast, but it does not compromise other valuable vector functions
	\item By using the principle of "sharing" the space complexity of the datastructure can also be minimised

\end{itemize}
